# techdrome-assignment

This Project is done as an assignment for internship opportunity by techdrome for frontend.

This app fetches information about SpaceX Rocket Launches using SpaceX api with some custom filters.
Features:
1. Client Side rendering.
2. Fetches Data dynamically. First time Data fetching is without any custom filters.

Approach:
1. ReactJs is used to build the app with vanilla CSS.
2. Media Queries added for responsiveness.
3. Mobile first approach as all other css code is inside media queries.
4. Various aspects of website are broken into different componenets.
5. FetchAPI is used to Fetch Data.
6. Radio buttons used for implementing filters.
7. Array Destructuring Done to get data in proper format.
9. CSS uses grid and flex in combination to display components.
10. Flex is used for general layout while grid is used to arrange cards.

Visual design asked:
1 Page should visually match with the provided designs.
2.Responsive Behavior – Expectation is to do a custom media query implementation and not use bootstrap or similar responsive framework:
▪ Implementation should follow Mobile first design approach
▪ Mobile View: Page should have only one Column until 700 px. We have provided the Visual designs for Mobile screen.
▪ Tablet View: Page should have 2 columns between 700 and 1024 px. Design is provided for Desktop tile and that should be followed for this viewport.
▪ Desktop View: Page should have 4 columns between 1024 and 1440 px. Beyond 1440px viewport, the content will be centered align.
